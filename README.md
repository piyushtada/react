# Complete React Developer

We install React developer tools from chrome store
> JSX : html like code that we use in side js
 Declaraive: it means we define the data and the state and react make the changes to the website to show our changes

```bash
//to get the version
node -v
npm -v
yarn -v
```

Difference bw npm vs npx
Is that with npm you keep the package in the local directory but with npx we dowload the package execute it and remove it from the local directory

# React
```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
```

**react scripts** in package.json is there to make our life simple we describe ==scripts== in the dictionary below to do what we want
